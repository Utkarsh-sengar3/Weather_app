    <!-- Indian Civilization Section -->
    <button class="collapsible">Indian Civilization</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Indian civilization has a rich history of weather prediction rooted in traditional knowledge, nature observations, and scientific advancements.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/India_southwest_summer_monsoon_onset_map_en.svg" width="400" height="500">
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Vedic and Ancient Texts</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rigveda and Atharvaveda:</b> These ancient texts contain hymns and descriptions that suggest early forms of weather prediction and understanding of seasons. Rituals and prayers were often tied to agricultural cycles and weather conditions.</li>
                    <li><B>Jyotisha (Astrology):</B> Ancient Indian astrology included weather prediction as part of its study. The position of stars and planets was believed to influence weather patterns, and astrologers would make predictions based on celestial observations.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Panchangam (Hindu Calendar)</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><B>Observations of Nature:</B> Traditional methods included observing animal behavior, cloud formations, wind directions, and other natural signs. For example, the behavior of ants, birds, and flowering patterns of certain trees were used to predict rain.</li>
                    <li><b>Local Proverbs and Folk Wisdom:</b> Various regions in India have their own set of proverbs and sayings that relate to weather prediction, often derived from centuries of local observations.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Agricultural Practices</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ancient Indian civilization was largely agrarian, so predicting weather was crucial for farming. The monsoon was particularly important, and communities developed a deep understanding of monsoon patterns, even using the blooming of certain plants like the Neelakurinji (which blooms every 12 years) as a natural indicator.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Navagrahas and Rainfall Predictions</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Indian mythology, the Navagrahas (nine planets) are believed to have an influence on weather. The worship of certain deities associated with rain, such as Lord Indra, the god of rain and thunderstorms, was a common practice for invoking good weather</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Advancements Over Time</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over centuries, these traditional methods were complemented by more systematic approaches with the advent of Indian texts on astronomy and meteorology. Scholars like Varahamihira, an ancient Indian astronomer and mathematician, wrote extensively on weather prediction in his works like the "Brihat Samhita," which detailed various techniques for forecasting weather based on lunar and solar cycles</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Modern Integration</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Today, while modern meteorological techniques are widely used in India, traditional knowledge is still valued, especially in rural areas. The integration of ancient wisdom with modern weather forecasting methods continues to provide a holistic approach to understanding weather patterns in India</li>

    <!-- Modern Times Section -->
    <button class="collapsible">Modern Times</button>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>20th Century</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP):</b> The advent of computers in the mid-20th century enabled the development of complex numerical models to predict weather. The first numerical weather predictions were made in the 1950s, using early computers to simulate atmospheric processes.</li>
            <li><b>Satellite Technology:</b> The launch of the first weather satellite, TIROS-1, in 1960 provided real-time data on weather patterns from space, drastically improving forecasting accuracy and providing global coverage.</li>
            <li><b>Radar Technology:</b> Weather radar, developed in the mid-20th century, allowed meteorologists to track precipitation and storm systems in detail.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>21st Century</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Advanced Models and Data Integration:</b> Modern weather forecasting utilizes sophisticated computer models, satellite data, and radar observations to provide highly accurate short-term and long-term forecasts. Data assimilation techniques integrate various sources of information for better predictions.</li>
        <li><b>Real-Time Communication:</b> The proliferation of the internet and mobile technology has made weather forecasts widely accessible in real time, with interactive tools and apps offering personalized weather updates and alerts.</li>
        <li><b>Climate Models:</b> Advances in climate modeling have improved understanding of long-term weather patterns and climate change, aiding in predicting future climate trends and their impacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Future</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</b> AI and machine learning are increasingly being used to refine weather predictions by analyzing vast amounts of data more efficiently and identifying patterns that traditional methods might miss.</li>
        <li><b>Global Collaboration:</b> International cooperation continues to enhance weather prediction capabilities, with organizations like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) facilitating data sharing and joint research efforts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Factor Effecting Weather</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Temperature:</b> Driven by solar radiation, temperature varies based on geographical location, time of year, and altitude. Areas closer to the equator generally experience warmer temperatures compared to those further away.</li>
        <li><b>Humidity:</b> The amount of moisture in the air affects weather patterns. High humidity can lead to cloud formation and precipitation, while low humidity can result in dry conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Air Pressure:</b> Variations in atmospheric pressure influence wind patterns and weather systems. Low-pressure systems are often associated with stormy and unsettled weather, whereas high-pressure systems typically bring clear skies and calm conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Wind:</b> Wind patterns are determined by the movement of air masses and pressure differences. Winds can transport moist or dry air, impacting local weather conditions and influencing temperature.</li>
        <li><b>Topography:</b> Geographic features such as mountains, valleys, and bodies of water can significantly affect weather. For example, mountains can block or enhance precipitation, and coastal areas often experience milder temperatures compared to inland regions.</li>
        <li><b>Ocean Currents:</b> Sea surface temperatures and ocean currents influence coastal weather patterns. Warm currents can lead to higher temperatures and increased rainfall, while cold currents can have the opposite effect.</li>
